# Website-Blocker
It does not let you browse certain websites during work hours .
Pass website link and time ,and this program will block those website during working hours,thus increases productivity
for example you want to block an website let xyz.com ,so you just need to add this name in the lsit of website and update the time according to yours requirement

In linux/windows,they have host file which have link which you want to block at a time.
so by this program we will try to make changes to host file during the working hours and remove the link if present in the host file if it is not a working hour.
